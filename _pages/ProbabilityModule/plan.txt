Part 1: Basics of probability

* Probability as a venn diagram
* The complement of an event (sunny vs not sunny). In Seattle 164 days at least partly sunny

* Joint probabilities
- Event space: All students taking a class with Prof. Tralie this fall (30)
373: 16, 477: 22
In common: 8

* Probability of OR
Driving into work on Schuykill vs driving home, traffic

* Disjoint probabilities
Ex) CS Students: 173 disjoint from 373, 477




Exercise: Summer/cloudy/thunderstorm

--------------------------------------
Part 2: Conditional Probabilities
* Definition of conditional probability, with picture
* Example of conditional probability with CS 371 and CS 477 living in space of all Ursinus students (roughly 1500)


* Definition of independence


Exercise:
* Which of these events are independent?  Which of these events are disjoint?

 
* The fire alarm goes of 1% of nights.  0.1% of nights, the fire alarm goes off and there is actually a fire.  What is the probability that there's actually a fire given the fire alarm is going off?



--------------------------------------

In class: 

* Present Bayes rule
* COVID testing example

* Connection to models, definition of likelihood

* The Bayesian chain rule, Naive bayes


--------------------------------------
[Due friday]
Part 4: Markov Chains
* Show implication of disjoint nature and independence assumption with venn diagram
* Write out equation for a.a
* Build a matrix, show matrix multiplication (column gives input, row gives output)


------------------
IN CLASS:


Part 5: Bayes Rule Part 2
* Definitiion of prior and posterior probabilities
* Definition of likelihood
