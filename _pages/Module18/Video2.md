The last assignment in this course is going to consist of <i>learning</i> these <code>H</code> matrices to create music from a bunch of sounds snippets from different sources.  The goal will be to try to get the columns multiplied by <code>H</code> to match a target sound, but we'll tolerate some error so that we preserve the timbre of the source sounds.  In particular, we'll be implementing a paper called <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303667582_Let_It_Bee_--_Towards_NMF-Inspired_Audio_Mosaicing">Let It Bee: Towards NMF-Inspired Audio Musaicing</a>.  It will allow us to do things like this:

I wrote some open source code to implement this technique (I'll have you write your own version of it), and a musician, <a href = "https://www.berklee.edu/people/ben-cantil">Ben Cantil</a>, stumbled across it and has been using it in his compositions.  We had a really nice meeting last week, and he was gracious enough to make a video describing his work.  <a href = "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/4dfb00c7-a224-4484-96a4-e9b812297b37">Click here</a> to watch the video, shared exclusively with the class this semester.

Ben believes this could be a revolution in electronic music, and I agree.  Be amazed, and be inspired for what you might do on your musical statements on this last assignment.  I'm going to have them worth more than usual to encourage creativity.  Again, you could have some of the first every music in a new style that may catch on in a decade or so.  Think of what you might want to name the genre!
