<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A Euclidean vector can be thought of as an arrow with a direction and a magnitude.  It can also be written as a tuple.  In 2D, the tuple is written with two coordinates as (x, y).  Though in this class, we will go well beyond to higher dimensions.</li>
  <li>Two vectors can be added together by summing their corresponding tuple entries.  There is a nice geometric interpretation of this known as the "parallelogram rule" or the "tip to tail rule."</li>
</ul>
